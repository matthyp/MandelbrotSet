# Complex numbers
## Square roots
The solution of x squared equals n.
Negative squared equals positive.
The sqrt of negative 1 equals the imaginary.
## Real and imaginary
Complex numbers is x plus y i where y is not 0.
Real numbers is x plus y i where y is 0.
Imaginary numbers is x plus y i where x is 0.
# The fractal
Take any point c and let z equal 0.
If c is part of the set, then it does not diverge and if c is not then it diverge.
The formula is f of z equals z squared plus c.
If c equals 1:
0 squared + 1 = 1,
1 squared + 1 = 2,
2 squared + 1 = 5,
5 squared + 1 = 26,
and so on.
The z is escape to infinty or diverge so it is not.
If c equals -1:
0 squared - 1 = -1,
-1 squared - 1 = 0,
0 squared - 1 = -1,
-1 squared - 1 = 0,
and so on.
The z does not diverge so it is part.
If m is the amount of iterations, then iterate f m times.
